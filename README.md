# Python-Linear-Regression
Implementation of linear regression for evaluating the criterion by three parameters. 3 parameters were selected, 4 predicted. 
The 3 parameters were divided into a training and a test sample.  
The rmse standard error was calculated, the input data was checked for a normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test, a histogram was built for comparing the data, 
a regression line was implemented(to see the data points better on the graph, you need to zoom in an image in the pyplot window). 
The data was downloaded from - https://www.kaggle.com/paree24/development-index
Made by Artur Fatkhutdinov as part of a task at the university.
